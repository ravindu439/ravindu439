### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Peradeniya (Faculty of Engineering). My academic journey has given me a solid grounding in both theoretical and practical aspects of computing. I’m passionate about exploring cutting-edge technologies, software development, computer architecture, embedded systems, and systematic debugging.  
Currently I’m honing deeper skills in processor design, hardware/software co-design, and applying embedded intelligence to solve real-world safety and usability problems.

- 🔭 Current Focus: Embedded systems design & RISC-V microarchitecture exploration  
- 🧠 Strengths: Hardware/software integration, structured problem-solving, rapid learning  
- 🌱 Learning Next: Advanced verification flows & performance profiling in Verilog/C++  
- 💬 Ask me about: Verilog, pipeline design, debugging embedded flows, full-stack prototypes  
- 🎯 2025 Goal: Ship an open-source reusable embedded safety module + publish a tech write-up  
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I enjoy “chasing the glitch”—I once traced a tricky timing issue by crafting a custom waveform diff approach.

### 🧩 Motivation
> “Engineering isn’t just solving problems—it’s designing reliability before problems appear.”

I aim to build systems that are safe, efficient, and insightful—bridging the gap between hardware realities and software agility.
